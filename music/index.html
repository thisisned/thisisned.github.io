  <p>I've been involved in a couple of music-making projects. Here are the main ones with things on the internet. They're both pretty loud.</p>

  <p>Victory Points</p>
  <p>A band that I got together with a couple of friends in 2011. We played a lot of shows near where we live, probably got played on local radio a few times, and could probably optimistically be described as 'energetic but scrappy'. I played guitar and recorded this EP in a large garden shed in early 2012. The production quality is pretty terrible but I maintain that the songs hold up OK when I'm feeling nostalgic. On indefinite hiatus since mid-2013.</p>

  <p>Grieving</p>
  <p>A current band, started around the end of 2015. I'm playing guitar again. We're probably playing a show soon somewhere around Cambridge or London, look us up on whatever social media I guess. Have been mentioned in Kerrang(!) and also played a few times on BBC Radio 1 and once or twice on 6 Music. Less death-metal than the name would suggest. I still don't feel great about the name but there you go.</p>

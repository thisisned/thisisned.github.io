  <p>I've been involved in a couple of music-making projects. Here are the main ones with things on the internet. They're both pretty loud.</p>

    <p>Grieving</p>
    <p>A current band, started around the end of 2015. I'm playing guitar again. We're probably playing a show soon somewhere around Cambridge or London, look us up on whatever social media I guess. Have been mentioned in Kerrang(!) and also played a few times on BBC Radio 1 and once or twice on 6 Music. Less death-metal than the name would suggest. I still don't feel great about the name but there you go.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p>I've also helped make music for a few short films my friends have made. E.g. this one about a cat. More film things I've been involved with <a href="http://www.projecttrident.com/members/ned/" target="_blank">you can find here</a> if you really want to go digging. You should really watch every video on <a href="http://www.projecttrident.com/videos/" target="_blank">the site</a> if you want to have an excellent time.</p></div>

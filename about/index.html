  <p>I'm Ned and I've made myself a personal website just for the hell of it, and to collect together the few things I have done in my life.</p>
  <p>Currently working in academic publishing but am always good with trying to learn things and tricking myself into feeling like a productive human being; mainly <a href="/computer">programming / web development stuff</a> at the moment.</p>
  <p>If you feel like I can help you out with anything you're doing or just want to say hey or hello for whatever reason get in touch why not.</p>
